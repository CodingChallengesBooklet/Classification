## Problem
A simple classification system asks a series of Yes/No questions in order to work out what type of animal is being looked at (E.g. Does it have 4 legs? Does it eat meat? Does it have stripes? Etc).

These systems can often be drawn using a “tree” structure. Carry out some simple research on classification trees, then write a program to help the user decide between the following:

```
horse, cow, sheep, pig, dog, cat, lion, tiger, whale, dolphin, seal, penguin, ostrich, sparrow, spider, ant, bee, wasp, termite, octopus, squid
```
Is there a better way to do this than using 101 IF...ELSE...END IFs?

Develop your classification system for your own area of interest: pop bands; pokemon; cars; footballers; teachers; diseases etc.

## Solution

### Why 100s of IF...ELSE...END IFs is impractical

### Our classification system

## Extension
Developing our own classification system for our own interests. Lets do books.
